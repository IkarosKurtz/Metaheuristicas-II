# ðŸš€ Metaheuristics II 

<p align="left">
This repository contains all the code for homework, projects, and activities related to the Metaheuristics II course at <strong>Universidad AutÃ³noma de Aguascalientes</strong>. Each project will be organized in its own folder and will include a README.md file explaining its purpose. <strong>All comments in the code will be in Spanish, as required by the course and for my professor's review, as well as to facilitate collaboration with my teammates.</strong>

## ðŸ“‚ Projects 

### ðŸ§¬ [Genetic Algorithm](./Genetic_Algorithm/README.md)
The main purpose is to implement a genetic algorithm to solve the Onemax problem, which involves finding an individual with all ones.

### ðŸŽ¯ [Multiobjective Problem](./Multiobjective_Problem/README.md)
The main purpose is to implement a **multiobjective** optimization problem using the **pymoo framework**. The problem involves optimization of energy distribution with four objectives: minimizing energy losses, maximizing renewable energy usage, reducing operational costs, and maximizing system reliability, with the **MOEA/D** algorithm.
